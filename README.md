## Distinctiveness and Complexity

QuickBite stands out due to its combination of user authentication, dynamic menu management, and order processing — all built within the Django framework. The application includes:

- Secure user registration and login/logout using Django’s built-in authentication system.
- Database models to manage users, menu items, and orders.
- Dynamic templates rendering the menu and order status based on database data.
- Form handling for user inputs and order placements.
- Use of Django’s ORM for data querying and manipulation.

These features collectively satisfy the project’s distinctiveness and complexity requirements by showcasing integration of multiple Django components, real-world web app functionality, and database interactions.
